Combat sim!

How will this work?

1. Set a combat duration. This will be the core "while" loop that will tick down in counts of GCD seconds
2. Every loop we need to deal damage (based on ability priority)
3. Every loop we need to update our stats for procs and damage
4. Every loop we also need to increment ability CDs and buff durations
